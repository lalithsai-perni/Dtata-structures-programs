# Data Structures Programs in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures** in the C programming language.  
Each program focuses on clarity, modularity, and understanding of the core operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, and memory management.

## 📘 About This Repository

This project is designed to help students and beginners understand how different data structures work **internally** by building them from scratch using C.  
Every program is implemented using **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** principles for better structure and reusability.

## 🧩 Currently Implemented

### 🔹 Singly Linked List (ADT-based)
**File:** `singly_linked_list.c`

**Features:**
- Create a linked list dynamically  
- Insert a node:
  - Before a given value  
  - After a given value  
  - At a specific position  
- Delete a node:
  - By value  
  - At a specific position  
- Search for a value  
- Reverse the list  
- Display all elements  
- Free all allocated memory safely before exit

## 🚀 Upcoming Implementations

Planned additions to this repository include:
- Doubly Linked List  
- Circular Linked List  
- Stack (Array & Linked List implementation)  
- Queue (Array & Linked List implementation)  
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)  
- Graphs (Adjacency List & Matrix)  
- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
